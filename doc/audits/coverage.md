You are auditing whether new public surface in this template repo has matching
test coverage. The repo's TDD discipline in AGENTS.md requires properties for
parsers, encoders, transformers, and data conversions.

Read first:
- AGENTS.md, especially Repository conventions and TDD workflow.
- doc/reviews/calibration.md.
- The most recent 5 files in doc/plans/.

Mechanical pass:

1. Public conversion-shaped items without law coverage.
   For every public marker, constant, struct, or function that exposes
   parsing, encoding, conversion, normalization, or round-trip behavior,
   confirm there is a law/property battery covering the declared domain.
   Missing coverage is must-fix.

2. Public parsers, encoders, or transformers without proptests.
   Search newly changed public functions in `crates/`. If a function
   parses, serializes, converts, rounds, schedules, maps units, or
   transforms numeric/data domains, confirm a property test covers it.
   Missing coverage is must-fix.

3. Public modules with no tests.
   Find changed modules that introduce public surface but have no
   `#[cfg(test)]` unit tests and no integration coverage. Flag as
   must-fix unless the module is pure re-export glue.

4. Feature-gated public items without feature-gated tests.
   A public item behind a Cargo feature should have a test that runs
   with that feature or a documented reason it cannot be tested
   locally. Missing coverage is follow-up unless the item is a parser,
   transformer, or conversion.

5. Plan Verification drift.
   For the most recent 5 plans, every Verification table property must
   exist in code or appear in that plan's Review section as deferred
   with a concrete re-enablement path.

Judgment pass:

6. Happy-path-only tests for failure-prone APIs.
   Public APIs that reject, saturate, clamp, round, or cross thread/RT
   boundaries need negative or boundary coverage, not only success
   cases.

Output format:
- One section per category that has findings.
- Use exact severity labels `[must-fix]` and `[follow-up]`.
- Each finding: file:line, offending excerpt of at most 5 lines, rule
  violated, and the bug class it enables.
- If there are zero findings, output exactly:
  `no findings`

Anti-themes:
- Historical `doc/plans/` and `doc/reviews/` files preserve past
  decisions. Do not require old plans to match current code unless the
  current branch is implementing that plan.
- Pure re-export modules do not need their own tests when the exported
  item has coverage at its owner.
