# AGENTS.md

`AGENTS.md` is the shared instruction file for Codex, Claude Code, and
other coding agents. `CLAUDE.md` is a compatibility symlink back to this
file. Claude Code-specific commands and settings remain under `.claude/`.

## What this repo is

<!-- Replace this section with your project description. -->

A Rust workspace with multiple crates.

## Parallel work

At the start of each conversation, ask the user:
"Are any other agent instances working in this repo right now?"

If yes, a worktree is **mandatory** — see the TDD workflow's Step 1
for the naming convention (`../<repo>.plan-YYYY-MM-DD-NN` + branch
`plan/YYYY-MM-DD-NN`).

Never run two agent instances in the same worktree. Cargo takes a
file lock on `target/` during each build, so concurrent builds stall
behind each other ("Blocking waiting for file lock"). Separate
worktrees each get their own `target/` and sidestep the lock —
**unless** `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is exported in your shell or
`~/.cargo/config.toml` sets `[build] target-dir`, either of which
forces every worktree to share one directory and reintroduces the
lock. Verify with `cargo metadata --format-version 1 --no-deps | jq -r .target_directory`
in two worktrees — different paths = safe.

## Workflow Is a State Machine

The TDD and review workflow is a finite state machine, not a menu of
roughly-equivalent steps. Before committing, running local review,
pushing, replying to review comments, or merging, agents must identify
the current state and take only the documented transition out of it.
Use `scripts/workflow_state.sh` as a read-only state check when the
state is not obvious.

The intended path is:

```
main_clean
  -> on_branch
  -> plan_committed
  -> impl_green
  -> plan_finalized
  -> local_reviewed
  -> pushed
  -> gh_review
  -> items_pulled
  -> round_unpushed
  -> gh_review
  -> merged
```

Do not skip, reorder, or replace a transition with an ad hoc command
that merely looks equivalent. Use the repo scripts and commands for
workflow-sensitive actions:

- Local review: Claude Code uses `/pr-review`; Codex and shell
  users use `scripts/pr_review.sh`. Claude Code's built-in
  `/review [PR]` is optional post-push review help, not the canonical
  pre-push transition.
- PR body pathing: `scripts/pr_report.py path` and
  `scripts/pr_report.py body`.
- GitHub review ingestion: `scripts/pr_report.py reviews`.
- Review replies: `/pr-reply` or the underlying
  `scripts/pr_reply.py` + `scripts/pr_report.py reviews` flow.
- Merge: `scripts/git_merge.sh`, not raw `gh pr merge`.

## Project Architecture

<!-- Replace this section with your architecture overview. -->

### Rust Workspace

```
Cargo.toml              — workspace root
rust-toolchain.toml     — pinned Rust version (1.85) + components for local and CI
rustfmt.toml            — formatter config (edition 2024)
deny.toml               — cargo-deny license/advisory/source policy
crates/
  project/              — public facade crate; exposes `project::core`
  core/                 — shared types, test utilities, proptest strategies
  cli/                  — binary entrypoint; feature-gates optional lib crates
```

The active Rust toolchain is pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml`; `rustup`
reads it automatically when you `cd` into the repo, and CI installs
the same channel via `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@1.85.0`. Bumping MSRV
means updating `rust-version` in `Cargo.toml`, the channel in
`rust-toolchain.toml`, and the action ref in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
together.

Feature flags on the facade and binary crates control which library crates
are compiled in:

```toml
[features]
default = ["core"]
core = ["dep:project-core"]
```

### Session Notes

`doc/notes/` is gitignored and holds the user's personal notes for the
project. Agents may read from it for context but must not write to it
unless explicitly asked.

## Repository Rules

- **Each pushed commit must leave the repo green** (`cargo test --workspace`
  + `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`).
  Do not commit a library module without the tests that cover it in the
  same commit. Intra-branch commits can be transiently red between
  commit and push; the pre-push hook is the gate, and CI verifies the
  pushed state.
- **No merge commits.** Always rebase onto main — never `git merge`. The
  history must be linear.
- **CI-repair commits must be fixups.** If a commit on this branch broke
  CI and the follow-up exists only to repair it, commit with
  `git commit --fixup=<broken-sha>` instead of a standalone `fix:`.
  Before pushing, run `scripts/git_squash.sh` (a thin wrapper over
  `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=: git rebase -i --autosquash origin/main`) so the
  fixups collapse into their targets. This keeps main's linear history
  free of commits that temporarily broke the build. Review-round commits
  (addressing reviewer feedback from an earlier push) remain standalone
  so the audit trail survives.
- **No unsafe code**: every crate root must declare `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`.
- **Inter-module imports respect the template partial order.**

  `project-core` (`crates/core/src`) starts with a small reusable DAG:

      test -> conn
      conn -> (leaf)

  `project-cli` (`crates/cli/src`) starts with:

      command -> parse
      parse   -> (leaf)

  Each top-level module-root file declares its allowed deps in a
  sentinel header comment:

      //! layer: test
      //! depends-on: conn

  `scripts/check_layers.sh` parses these headers and fails on any
  production-code `use crate::<top>`, `use project_core::<top>`, or
  `use project::<top>` import that names a module in that crate's
  layer set but is not listed in the current layer's `depends-on:`
  sentinel. Adding a new edge requires updating both the sentinel and
  this rule's prose so the gate and convention stay in sync.
- **Test fixtures are gitignored**, and a fresh checkout must pass
  `cargo test --workspace` with zero setup. Tests that depend on a
  fixture file must use the `fixture_or_skip!` macro from the core
  crate and `return` cleanly when the fixture is absent — **do not**
  `#[ignore]` them and do not panic.
- **Property-based testing is mandatory** for any module that parses,
  encodes, or transforms data. Use `proptest` (workspace dev-dep).
  - Define strategies as functions returning `impl Strategy`, not
    `Arbitrary` derive. Use `prop_oneof!` with frequency weights to
    bias toward boundary values and edge cases.
  - Strategies shared across crates live in `crates/core/src/arb.rs`.
    Strategies local to one module stay colocated in that module's
    `#[cfg(test)]` block.
  - Properties that must hold for a sprint to ship are defined **in
    the plan's Verification table** before any code is written.
  - If a property test blocks progress during implementation, you may
    `#[ignore]` it temporarily but **you must document it** in the
    plan's Review section with the reason and a plan to re-enable.
- **Use Rust's modern module layout.** If you have a specific reason
  not to, **document it**. The modern layout does not have a `mod.rs`
  file. The equivalent module sits one level up and is named after
  the module directory:

  ```
  src/
  ├── main.rs
  ├── network.rs      <-- Defines 'network' module
  └── network/
      └── server.rs   <-- Submodule of 'network'
  ```

## Be a Good Gardener

Weeds are weeds, regardless of who planted them. Whenever an agent
encounters a violation of any rule in this file — stale comment
referencing a renamed identifier, proptest generator bounded to
dodge a wrap, `expect()` string that lies about its precondition,
`#[ignore]`d test without a re-enablement plan, missing proptest
the verification table mandated, etc. — it does not get to silently
walk past because "I didn't write that."

**Minimum bar:**

- **Flag it.** List the violation in the plan's `## Review` section:
  `file:line — rule — one-sentence consequence`.
- **Offer to fix the minor ones.** Local, single-file, no API
  change, doesn't expand sprint scope: ask the user in chat before
  merging. ("I noticed `foo/bar.rs:42` still says `old_name`; fold
  the fix into this branch?") The user decides.
- **Defer the rest with a tracking note.** If the fix is too big to
  absorb in the current sprint, the `## Review` entry IS the plan:
  name the cleanup specifically enough that the next plan branch
  can pick it up.

**What does NOT need surfacing.** Drift CI already catches: `cargo
fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
`gitleaks`, `scripts/check_pii.sh`. The gate is the safety net for
those.

**What MUST be surfaced.** Anything that lives below the CI gate
because compilation and clippy are blind to it: stale prose, doc
links to renamed-away identifiers, decorative tests that pass
trivially, mis-bounded generators that fake coverage, section
headers that name the old thing, `expect()` panic strings that
contradict the actual precondition, deferred properties from a
previous plan's Verification table that never got written. Those
are exactly the weeds humans don't notice on a fast skim.

This rule applies to every agent — `feat:`, `debt:`, `fix:`, the
review agents, `/pr-watch` auto-fix. A `feat:` agent that walks past
a stale comment in the file it's editing plants a weed that sprouts
three sprints later, when somebody trusts the comment and writes
code based on it.

This repo is your garden, please treat it with love and care.

## Test-Driven Development Workflow

Every sprint follows this order. Naming is keyed to the plan filename:
a plan at `doc/plans/plan-YYYY-MM-DD-NN.md` maps to branch
`plan/YYYY-MM-DD-NN` and (if used) worktree `../<repo>.plan-YYYY-MM-DD-NN`.
One slug, three places.

1. **Pick the plan filename.** `ls doc/plans/plan-YYYY-MM-DD-*.md` to
   find the next unused `NN` for today's date (zero-padded, starts at
   `01`). No writes yet — main stays clean.
2. **Ask the user: worktree or branch?** Worktree is mandatory if
   another agent instance is active in this repo; otherwise it's the
   user's call. Then:
   - worktree: `git worktree add ../<repo>.plan-YYYY-MM-DD-NN -b plan/YYYY-MM-DD-NN`, `cd` into it.
   - branch: `git switch -c plan/YYYY-MM-DD-NN`.
3. **Write the plan** to `doc/plans/plan-YYYY-MM-DD-NN.md` on that branch.
   The plan's **Verification** table must list the property tests that
   must pass for the sprint to ship (e.g., "message round-trips through
   encode/decode", "parser never panics on arbitrary input"). Commit
   as `plan: <one-line goal>` — this is the sprint-opener, always the
   first commit on the branch. See the last section for plan formatting.
4. Write proptest properties and test skeletons that compile but
   trivially fail. Properties come first — they define the contract.
5. Implement the module until all tests are green.
6. Commit on the branch, when green.
7. **Finalize the sprint docs.** In one commit:
   - Append Deferred and Review sections to the plan document. If any
     property tests were `#[ignore]`d during implementation, document
     the reason and the re-enablement plan here.
   - Create the review file at `$(scripts/pr_report.py path)` (no
     argument predicts the next PR number and zero-pads the
     filename). Header is `# PR #<N> — <title>` followed by a
     `## Summary` section containing the PR body. This section is
     consumed verbatim by
     `gh pr create --body-file <(scripts/pr_report.py body N)`, so
     write it as the PR description (what & why for a human
     reviewer) — not a ship-report.

   This must happen *before* the local review — the reviewer agent
   reads the plan as context and should see the final version, and
   local-review command aborts if the review file is missing its
   `## Summary`. Commit as `doc: Finalize plan NN and PR description`.
8. Run the local review transition before pushing:
   - Claude Code: `/pr-review`
   - Codex/shell: `scripts/pr_review.sh`
9. Rebase and land on main. First, on the feature branch:
   `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main`. Then fast-forward main:
   - **Branch case**: `git checkout main && git merge --ff-only plan/YYYY-MM-DD-NN`.
   - **Worktree case**: main is already checked out in the *primary*
     worktree, so you can't `checkout main` here. `cd` back to the
     primary and run `git merge --ff-only plan/YYYY-MM-DD-NN` there.
     Step 10's `git worktree remove` then runs from the primary too.
10. Clean up: `git worktree remove ../<repo>.plan-YYYY-MM-DD-NN`
    (worktree case only), then `git branch -d plan/YYYY-MM-DD-NN`.

### Git Hooks

Three complementary layers guard local changes:

**Layer 1 — Claude Code `PreToolUse`** (`.claude/settings.json`):
fires on agent-invoked Bash calls matching `git commit*`. Catches
issues during agent iteration without invoking git for real.
Limitation: `PreToolUse` runs *before* the matched Bash call's body
executes, so a chained command like `git add file && git commit -m
"..."` sees an empty pre-add staged diff at hook time and slips
through `check_pii.sh`. Use separate `git add` and `git commit`
calls to keep this layer effective.

**Layer 2 — Git `pre-commit`** (`.githooks/pre-commit`): fires at
git's standard hook point (after staging, before commit object
creation). Sees the actual staged content regardless of how the commit
was invoked. This is the cheap commit-time safety net.

**Layer 3 — Git `pre-push`** (`.githooks/pre-push`): fires once per
push for non-delete refs. It runs the expensive workspace test and
clippy suite on the exact state being sent to the remote.

Activate Layers 2 and 3 on a fresh clone:

```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The commit-time chain is blocking:

1. `cargo fmt --all -- --check` — fmt drift aborts the commit. Run
   `cargo fmt --all` to fix. CI still runs fmt in warn-only mode, so
   the local hook is the blocking gate that prevents drift from being
   papered over with a warning.
2. `scripts/check_pii.sh` — grep the staged diff for absolute
   user-home paths (`/Users/...` on macOS, `/home/...` on Linux),
   private-key headers, and common API-token shapes. Fail fast on
   any match. Allow-list exceptions go in `.pii-allow`.
3. `scripts/check_layers.sh` — enforce the module partial orders.

The push-time chain is also blocking:

1. `cargo test --workspace` — all tests must pass.
2. `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` — matches CI.

These are the automated quality gates; the local review transition
(`/pr-review` for Claude Code, `scripts/pr_review.sh` for
Codex/shell) is the manual one. Bypass either Git hook with
`--no-verify` only when explicitly authorized.

CI adds a `gitleaks` job (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that scans the
full history on every PR as defense-in-depth against anything that
bypasses both local hooks (e.g. `git commit --no-verify`, or a
clone where `core.hooksPath` was never set).

## Code Review Workflow

`doc/workflow.md` has mermaid state diagrams for the review-round
lifecycle and the `/pr-watch` loop — useful when debugging an
unexpected situation (stuck fix commit, loop that won't quit). The
prose below is authoritative; the diagrams are derived views.

### Tier 1 — Local Review (pre-push)

The coding agent makes atomic commits as it works. Commits can be as
small as desired; the pushed branch tip must pass `cargo test` and
`cargo clippy` via `.githooks/pre-push`.

Step 7 of the TDD workflow creates the PR's review file with the
sprint's PR description under a `## Summary` heading. The path comes
from `scripts/pr_report.py path` — no argument, it predicts the next PR
number (via `scripts/pr_request.sh`) and emits the zero-padded
filename, e.g. `doc/reviews/review-00017.md`. The `## Summary`
section is the single source of truth for the PR body: open the PR
with `gh pr create --body-file <(scripts/pr_report.py body N)` so
the GitHub body is a direct copy of the file. Because the
description is committed *before* push, a PR that gets no review
comments merges without any extra round-trip — the body is already
in history. `review-00000.md` is a protected sentinel; real reviews
start at `00001`.

Before pushing, run the local review transition. Claude Code uses the
repo-specific `/pr-review` command. Codex and shell users use
`scripts/pr_review.sh`, which invokes `codex review --base
origin/main` with the repo conventions and calibration examples. Both
paths examine `git diff origin/main...HEAD` and the commit log, then
append findings as a `## Local review (YYYY-MM-DD)` section below the
summary. The local-review command aborts if the review file or its
`## Summary` section is missing — step 7 is a prerequisite. Claude
Code's built-in `/review [PR]` may be useful after a PR exists, but it
is not the canonical pre-push FSM transition.

If another issue or PR is opened between running step 7 and opening
this branch's PR, the predicted number can drift — re-run
`scripts/pr_report.py path` before pushing and `mv` the old file to the
new path if needed.

If must-fix items exist, resolve them before pushing. If the review
is clean, push and open the PR with `--body-file` as above.

### Tier 2 — GitHub Review (post-push)

Once pushed, CI runs `cargo test --workspace` and
`cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` (see
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Claude Code Action and/or GitHub Copilot
perform a second-round review on the PR automatically.

After GitHub review activity, run `/pr-report <N>` to fetch the PR's
review bodies and inline comments and **append them chronologically to the
same `doc/reviews/review-NNNNN.md`** used by Tier 1. The command is
idempotent — it records `<!-- gh-id: NNNNN -->` markers for each appended
item and skips any id already present, so running it repeatedly only
appends new comments. The result is one file per PR containing the full
local + GitHub review history in order.

Once the findings are addressed as **uncommitted edits in the working
tree**, run `/pr-reply <N>`. The command does the whole round
in order: posts replies to each unresolved thread, runs
`scripts/pr_report.py reviews` to mirror the replies into `review-NNNNN.md`,
then makes ONE atomic commit containing both the code edits and the
mirrored doc. You then `git push` once — code + replies + review doc
land in a single round trip.

**Do not commit the fix yourself before running `/pr-reply`.**
The command runs on the `gh_review → items_pulled → round_unpushed`
arrow per `doc/workflow.md` — it expects to start from `gh_review`
(local at-or-behind origin) and produce the round commit itself.
Pre-committing a fix would put the branch at an unpushed-state that
breaks the precondition; if you have a stranded pre-existing fix
commit, push it first, then re-run. `/pr-reply` refuses to run
if the branch already has unpushed commits.

**Do not merge before pushing the round commit.** Per
`doc/workflow.md`'s state machine, the merge transition is
`gh_review → merged` — there is no edge from `round_unpushed → merged`.
Merging from `round_unpushed` (the state after `/pr-reply`
makes its commit but before push) silently drops the local commit
because `gh pr merge` is GitHub-side and doesn't see local state.
Use `scripts/git_merge.sh <pr-args>` instead of `gh pr merge` —
the wrapper refuses to invoke the merge while the local branch
is ahead of origin. Recovery (if a merge already dropped a round
commit): cherry-pick the stranded SHA into the next plan branch's
first commit per the bundle-into-next-plan convention; don't open
a tiny standalone PR.

`/pr-report <N>` remains available as a lower-level primitive for
fetching comments without posting. Use it standalone only to refresh
the doc right before the final pre-merge push, to capture any trailing
reviewer comments; its output rides with the next round commit, never
as a standalone `doc:` commit.

The local review catches design issues and convention violations early.
The GitHub review catches anything that slipped through and validates in
the CI environment. Joining them into a single file per PR preserves the
conversational flow and keeps the review record in one place.

### PR Polling (optional)

For PRs where you don't want to manually ping "check the replies", pair
`/pr-watch <N>` with `/loop`:

```
/loop 10m /pr-watch 17
```

Each tick does one of: (a) heartbeat if no new activity, (b) one
finish-the-round cycle — auto-fix the trivially-clear items, push back
or defer the rest, run the `/pr-reply` flow, **push the round
commit**, or (c) `paused at round_unpushed: push failed` if the push
itself errored (network, non-fast-forward).

Auto-fix is scoped tightly: only items where the reviewer's intent is
unambiguous and the change is local (one file, under ~20 lines, no
API removal, no cross-module reasoning). Anything involving judgment
is classified as **needs you** and surfaced in the round report with
`path:line` — those threads stay open on GitHub for you to resolve.

The command never **merges**. The merge is the user's safety gate:
each PR is reviewed manually before `gh pr merge` /
`scripts/git_merge.sh`. Pushing the round commit advances the
branch to `gh_review` so CI re-runs and the reviewer sees replies
attached to the right tip — that's normal mid-PR motion, not a risk
worth gating on.

### Commit Style

Conventional commits, present-tense imperative subject. Accepted prefixes:
`plan`, `feat`, `fix`, `fmt`, `doc`, `test`, `task`, `debt`. Scopes are
allowed (e.g. `doc(skills):`, `fix(scripts):`).

- `plan:` lands a new plan doc in `doc/plans/` — always the first
  commit on a `plan/YYYY-MM-DD-NN` branch.
- `feat:` and the rest cover the implementation that follows.

```
plan: Widget-format parser, sprint goals and verification table
feat: Add parser for widget format
fix(codec): Handle timeout on reconnect
test: Add round-trip property tests for codec
doc: Append Sprint 2 completion report
task: Add serde to core dependencies
debt: Remove dead handshake branch
```

Keep subjects under 72 characters. Use the body for non-obvious decisions.

## Sprint Plan Format

```markdown
# Plan NN — Title

## Goal
One sentence.

## Dependency Graph
ASCII art showing task dependencies (T1 → T2, T3 → T4, etc.)

## Tasks
Each task is T1, T2, etc. Each task section includes:
- Problem or motivation
- Solution / implementation approach
- Types or API surface

## Verification

### Properties (must pass)
Table of proptest property names, the module they live in, and the
invariant they assert. These are the contract — if a property can't
be satisfied, the sprint isn't done.

| Property | Module | Invariant |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| `msg_round_trips` | `crate_foo::codec` | encode then decode recovers original |

### Spot checks
Table of unit test names + specific assertions.

### Build gates
- cargo build — no errors
- cargo test — all pass (no `#[ignore]` without Review documentation)
- cargo clippy --all-targets — no errors
- End-to-end scenario description

## Deferred
What was intentionally left out and why.

## Review
- Any `#[ignore]`d properties: which ones, why, re-enablement plan
- Design deviations from the plan
- **Drift caught** (file:line — rule — fixed-here / deferred). See
  "The gardener rule" above. Even a clean sprint usually finds a few
  stale comments or test names; an empty list usually means the
  agent didn't look.
- Recommendations
```
