  Local pre-push code review (Tier 1). Spawns an independent reviewer agent
  to examine the branch diff against main. Use when the user says
  "/sprint-review", "review the branch", "review before push", or after
  completing work on a feature branch before pushing to GitHub.

# Sprint Review — Tier 1 (Local)

You are orchestrating a **local, pre-push** code review. This is Tier 1 of
a two-tier system:

- **Tier 1 (this skill):** Independent agent reviews `main...HEAD` locally.
  Gate before pushing.
- **Tier 2 (GitHub):** After push, CI runs build/test/clippy/fmt. Claude
  Code Action and/or Copilot review the PR on GitHub.

Your job: gather inputs, launch the reviewer, place the output, then help
the user push if the review passes.

---

## Step 1: Identify the plan (optional)

Check for a plan doc associated with this branch:

```
ls -t doc/plans/plan-*.md | head -3
```

If a plan exists and is clearly related to the branch work (check dates,
topic), read it. You'll pass its text to the reviewer.

If no plan exists or none is relevant, that's fine — the review proceeds
in **code-only mode** (no plan-conformance section).

## Step 2: Collect the diff

The review always targets the current branch against main:

```
git diff main...HEAD
git log main..HEAD --oneline
```

If the branch has not diverged from main, abort with a message — there's
nothing to review.

## Step 3: Gather context

Read these files and include them in the reviewer prompt:

- `CLAUDE.md` — repo conventions, workspace layout, TDD workflow, commit
  style, feature-gate conventions
- `doc/refs/review-calibration.md` — if it exists, include as few-shot
  examples. If absent, skip (the reviewer prompt has built-in guidance).

## Step 4: Launch the reviewer

Spawn a **new agent** with `subagent_type: "feature-dev:code-reviewer"` and
`model: "sonnet"`.

The prompt must be self-contained. Include:

1. The full diff
2. The commit log
3. The repo conventions from CLAUDE.md
4. The plan text (if found), clearly labeled as optional context
5. Calibration examples from `doc/refs/review-calibration.md` (if found)
6. The review instructions (below)

### Reviewer voice and calibration

The reviewer should write like a thorough human PR reviewer, not a checklist
robot. Good review comments share these qualities:

- **Cite the contract, then the violation.** When the plan says X and the code
  does Y, quote both. "The plan specifies `device = ["dep:tokio", ...]` as an
  optional feature gate (T1), but `Cargo.toml` lists tokio as unconditional."

- **Name the consequence.** Don't just say "this differs from the plan." Say
  what breaks: "This means `driver-motu` links tokio/russh/mdns despite only
  using HTTP+OSC, adding ~3s to clean builds."

- **Distinguish severity.** Some findings block the merge, others are
  improvement opportunities. Be explicit: "Must fix before merge" vs
  "Consider for a follow-up."

- **Don't pad.** If a section has no findings, one sentence: "All N planned
  tests are present and correctly gated." Don't invent concerns to fill space.

### Reviewer prompt template

~~~
You are reviewing code on a local feature branch before it is pushed to
GitHub. This is a pre-push quality gate — there is no PR yet. You are
reviewing the diff between main and the branch HEAD.

You are an independent reviewer. You did not write this code and have no
context beyond what is provided here. Review what you see, not what you
assume.

## Diff (main...HEAD)

{diff}

## Commit log (main..HEAD)

{commit log}

## Repo conventions

{CLAUDE.md contents}

{IF plan exists:}
## Sprint plan (optional context)

{plan text}

The plan is context, not a contract. Focus on whether the code is correct,
tested, and follows conventions. If the plan specifies verification criteria
(property tests, spot checks), confirm they exist in the diff.
{END IF}

{IF calibration examples exist:}
## Examples of high-quality review comments

{doc/refs/review-calibration.md contents}

Match this style: cite the contract (doc, plan, or naming), show how the
code violates it, and name the consequence. When something is fine, one
sentence is enough. Don't invent concerns to fill space.
{END IF}

## Review instructions

For each section, state what you found concretely. When something is wrong,
cite the specific file, line, and consequence. When something is fine, one
sentence is enough — don't pad.

### Commit Hygiene

- Does each commit leave the repo in a buildable, testable state?
- Are commit messages conventional (feat/fix/test/refactor/doc/chore prefix)?
- Are commits reasonably atomic, or are unrelated changes mixed?

### Code Quality

- Does the code follow repo conventions (thiserror in libs, no unsafe,
  lints via Cargo.toml)?
- Are error messages specific enough to diagnose from a log line?
  (e.g., "qu: tcp connect: {e}" is good; "operation failed" is not)
- Is there unintended coupling between driver crates that should be
  independent? (e.g., driver-qu importing types from driver-mpc)
- Any dead code, redundant logic, or clippy-level issues?
- Were any features, config options, or feature gates described in the
  plan but absent from the implementation? This is the highest-value
  check — plans often specify build configuration that gets lost.

### Test Coverage

**Property tests are the highest-priority check.**

- For any module that parses, encodes, or transforms data: are there
  property tests? If not, flag this as a gap.
- Do fixture-gated tests use `fixture_or_skip!` from
  `studio_core::testing` (return early when fixture is absent, don't
  panic, don't `#[ignore]`)?
- What edge cases do the tests miss? Be specific — "what happens if the
  TCP connection drops mid-NRPN" is useful; "more tests would be good"
  is not.

{IF plan exists:}
### Plan Conformance

- Walk each task (T1, T2, ...) and each row in the Verification table:
  was it implemented?
- For each planned test, does a corresponding test exist in the diff?
- Is there code in the diff that wasn't in the plan? Justified emergent
  requirement or undocumented scope creep?
{END IF}

### Risks

- TODOs, stubs, or placeholder implementations?
- Could any change break existing functionality in other crates?
- Security: path traversal in file operations? Command injection in SSH
  exec calls? Unsanitized input passed to shell commands?
- New dependencies justified and maintained?

### Recommendations

Separate into two lists:

**Must fix before push:**
- Issues that violate conventions, break tests, or introduce bugs.

**Follow-up (future work):**
- Improvements that are acceptable now but should be tracked.

## Output format

Structure your review as markdown with the H3 sections above. Be direct
and specific. Cite file paths and line numbers. Keep the total review under
400 lines. Prioritize by impact.
~~~

## Step 5: Place the output

Review files are organized by PR number: `doc/reviews/review-NNNN.md` where
`NNNN` is the zero-padded PR number (e.g., `review-0017.md`). Each file
accumulates all review rounds — local and GitHub — as dated sections.

When the reviewer agent returns:

1. **Determine the review file path.** If a PR already exists for this
   branch, use its number. If not (pre-push), ask the user for the
   expected PR number, or use `0000` as a placeholder and rename after
   the PR is created.

2. **Append** (do not overwrite) a dated section to
   `doc/reviews/review-NNNN.md` (create `doc/reviews/` and the file if
   they don't exist):

   ```markdown
   ## Local review (YYYY-MM-DD)

   **Branch:** <branch>
   **Commits:** <count> (main..<branch>)
   **Reviewer:** Claude (sonnet, independent)

   ---

   {reviewer output}
   ```

   If the file is new, add a top-level header first:

   ```markdown
   # PR #<N> — <PR title or branch name>
   ```

3. **Print a summary** to the conversation: how many must-fix items, how
   many follow-ups, and the path to the review file. One paragraph max.

4. **If zero must-fix items:**
   Tell the user the branch is clear to push. Offer to push and create a
   PR (but don't do it without confirmation). Remind them that Tier 2
   (CI + GitHub review) will run automatically on the PR.

5. **If must-fix items exist:**
   Stop. Do not push. Do not offer to fix the issues. The user reads the
   review and decides what to do next.
