# Pull Reviews — Fetch GitHub Comments to Local File

Fetch review comments from a GitHub PR and append new ones chronologically
to `doc/reviews/review-NNNN.md`. The heavy lifting lives in
`scripts/pull_reviews.py`; this skill is a thin wrapper around it.

---

## Step 1: Parse the PR number

The user provides a PR number as an argument (e.g., `/pull-reviews 17`).
If omitted, check if the current branch has an open PR:

```
gh pr view --json number --jq .number
```

If no PR is found, ask the user for the number.

## Step 2: Run the script

```
scripts/pull_reviews.py <N>
```

The script handles everything: fetches reviews and inline comments by
iterating `?per_page=100&page=N` explicitly against the GitHub API
(chosen over `gh api --paginate --slurp` because `--slurp` requires
gh >= 2.47), merges them chronologically, de-dupes via set membership
on `<!-- gh-id: -->` markers, hyperlinks headers to GitHub permalinks,
absolute-ifies relative links in bodies, and creates `review-NNNN.md`
with a `# PR #N — <title>` header if it doesn't exist.

The script is idempotent: any item whose `gh-id` is already present in
the file is skipped. Note: it is **not** safe to assume a single
"high-water mark" — GitHub draws review IDs and inline-comment IDs from
different sequences, so max-id across both would silently drop later
items from the lower-numbered sequence. Set membership avoids this.

## Step 3: Commit the updated file

If new items were appended, **commit `review-NNNN.md` to the PR branch**
— either as a standalone `doc: update review-NNNN.md` commit or folded
into the current round's fix commit. The review file must ride along
with the PR that generated it; landing it post-merge orphans the audit
trail.

If there were no new items (script reported `no new items`), skip this
step.

## Step 4: Report

Print a one-paragraph summary: how many new comments appended, from
which reviewers, and the path to the review file. Pipe through the
script's stdout if that's easier.

---

## Format contract (for reference / debugging)

The script writes three block shapes. If you're editing the file by hand
or extending the script, preserve these:

Top-level review body:

```markdown
<!-- gh-id: {id} -->
### {user} — {state} ([{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC}]({html_url}))

{body}
```

Inline comment (new thread). The `:line` suffix is omitted when the
GitHub API returns `line: null` (outdated diff comments or file-level
comments), so both `{path}` and `{path}:{line}` variants are valid:

```markdown
<!-- gh-id: {id} -->
### {user} on [`{path}`]({html_url}) ({YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC})
### {user} on [`{path}:{line}`]({html_url}) ({YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC})

{body}
```

Reply (has `in_reply_to_id`):

```markdown
<!-- gh-id: {id} -->
#### ↳ {user} ([{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC}]({html_url}))

{body}
```

## Notes

- **The script does not auto-commit.** The agent must stage and commit
  `review-NNNN.md` on the PR branch when new items were appended (see
  Step 3). The file must ride along with the PR — don't leave it
  untracked.
- **Idempotent** via set membership on `<!-- gh-id: -->` markers (not
  max-id, which would be unsound across review/comment sequences).
  Safe to re-run.
- **Chronological, not grouped.** Items are appended in posted order
  (by `created_at` / `submitted_at`). Replies are only indicated by
  `↳` formatting based on `in_reply_to_id`; they are not guaranteed
  to be adjacent to their parent — other comments posted in between
  will interleave.
