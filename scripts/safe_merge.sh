# safe_merge.sh — guard `gh pr merge` against the `round_unpushed`
# trap.
#
# `doc/workflow.md`'s state machine has no edge from `round_unpushed`
# to `merged`. The only path is `round_unpushed → push → gh_review →
# merged`. But `gh pr merge` is a GitHub-side operation; it doesn't
# know about local state. Merging while a round commit sits unpushed
# on the local branch silently drops it on the floor — the merge
# takes the remote head, and the local commit stays orphaned in the
# reflog.
#
# This script is the local-side enforcement: it resolves the PR's head
# branch (via `gh pr view`, *not* the currently-checked-out branch —
# safe_merge.sh 17 might be invoked from main), then refuses to invoke
# `gh pr merge` if that PR's local branch is ahead of its remote
# tracking ref. Re-run after `git push`.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/safe_merge.sh <gh-pr-merge-args...>
#
# Examples:
#   scripts/safe_merge.sh 17                      # interactive
#   scripts/safe_merge.sh 17 --rebase --delete-branch
#   scripts/safe_merge.sh --rebase                # current branch's open PR
#
# All arguments are forwarded verbatim to `gh pr merge` after the
# guard passes.

Resolves the PR's head branch via `gh pr view`, then refuses to run
if that local branch is ahead of its remote tracking ref. All
arguments are forwarded to `gh pr merge` once the guard passes.

Unpushed commits would be silently dropped by the merge:

$ahead

Per doc/workflow.md, the merge transition starts from gh_review (push
complete), not round_unpushed. Push first, then re-run:

    git push origin $head_ref
    $0 $*
