# Extracts the PR body from doc/reviews/review-NNNNN.md.
#
# The review file's `## Summary` section is the single source of truth
# for the PR body (see CLAUDE.md "Tier 1 — Local review"). This script
# extracts that section so `gh pr create --body-file` can feed it
# straight to GitHub:
#
#     gh pr create --title "..." \
#       --body-file <(scripts/extract_pr_body.sh 17)
#
# Content is taken between the `## Summary` heading (exclusive) and the
# first review marker (exclusive): `## Local review (` from
# /sprint-review or `<!-- gh-id: ` from pull_reviews.py. Sibling
# sections like `## Test plan` are NOT truncated. Printed verbatim to
# stdout.
#
# Fails loudly with a nonzero exit and a message on stderr if:
#   - the argument is missing or not numeric
#   - the review file doesn't exist
#   - the `## Summary` section is missing
#   - the `## Summary` section is empty (whitespace only)
#
# These checks prevent silently opening a PR with a blank body. Run
# from the repo root.
